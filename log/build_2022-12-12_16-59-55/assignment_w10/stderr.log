  By not providing "Findassignment_w10.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "assignment_w10", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "assignment_w10"
  with any of the following names:

    assignment_w10Config.cmake
    assignment_w10-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "assignment_w10" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "assignment_w10_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "assignment_w10" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
